## About After the Storm

“Love inspires remembering. It cause[s] ‘floods and floods of blocked memories’ to break…” —M. Jacqui Alexander

“After the Storm: A Digital Archive of Survival” is a multi-institutional, black and brown feminist **collaboration** that **documents and archives** the testimonios and oral histories of Black diasporic communities after ecological catastrophe, along the axis of race, gender and sexuality. Our collaborative is inspired by the #ProyectoPalabrasPuertoRico project, led by Dr. Yomaira Figueroa-Vasquez, and by the archival research of Dr. Teona Williams. Our aim is to bridge the U.S. South to the Caribbean, geographies that seems so disparate in our imagination, to show how the concept of catastrophe holds places together. We aim to amplify diasporic bonds and histories of struggle and rebellion without collapsing or flattening what makes each place unique. We think about how Afro diasporic women author their own survival rooted in place, build and rebuild new worlds, and speak back against colonial erasure that thrive in contemporary discourses around the end of the world.

In this work, we attend to the grief of Black and Brown women as the reflect on the loss they have experienced and the state negligence that created and exacerbated already precarious material conditions. We understand the necessity to create an archive that correctly remembers ecological catastrophe, since state sanction archives often paint a picture that is not there. We center the stories and voices of women who mobilize their communities, author restoration and survival, and resist . **This is a living, breathing archive, that is divided by collections that hold different histories.**

This lab makes up the archipelago of the Open Boat Lab directed by Dr. Yomaira Figueroa-Vásquez, which supports creation of digital archives, museum and gallery exhibits, and community workshops.The [OBL](https://diasporasolidarities.squarespace.com/obl-projects) builds ethical digital archives informed by community centers, public art and organizing practices, and offers online and in-person workshops that help to transform how we approach knowledge production, storytelling, documentation, and archives.

****The [Diaspora Solidarities Lab](https://www.dslprojects.org/) (DSL) is a multi-institutional Black feminist partnership that supports solidarity work in Black and Ethnic Studies conducted by undergraduates, graduate students, faculty members, and community partners who are committed to transformative justice and accountable to communities beyond the Western academy. We sponsor both traditional analog and digital experimental scholarship to build knowledge communities across institutions and geographies, training participants in the practices and principles of radical media, ethics of Black feminist praxis, and decolonial and antiracist principles. We emphasize the literacies of the born-digital and in-person ethical collaboration.**
